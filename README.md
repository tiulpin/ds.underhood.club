### Motivation

I wanted a way of storing tweets per weeks, like [@abroadunderhood](http://abroadunderhood.ru), but I
- don't want to host anything at all/spend resources for hostings
- need a good way of editing existing pages
- want it to look nice
- am not a frontend-developer, know nothing about JavaScript and so on
- can dockerize things and make them work

That's why I've created three main containers, that help make a website like üî•[underhood.club](https://underhood.club/)
- [`dumphood`](https://github.com/tiulpin/underhood.club/main/dumphood) ‚Äì downloading tweets using Twitter API
- [`topichood`](https://github.com/tiulpin/underhood.club/main/topichood) ‚Äì topic modeling on tweets
- [`notionhood`](https://github.com/tiulpin/underhood.club/main/notionhood) ‚Äì uploading already dumped tweets to Notion with a bit of NLP (NER for finding pages names)
