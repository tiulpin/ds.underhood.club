### Motivation

I wanted a way of storing tweets per weeks, like [@abroadunderhood](http://abroadunderhood.ru), but I
- don't want to host anything at all/spend resources for hostings
- need a good way of editing existing pages
- want it to look nice
- am not a frontend-developer, know nothing about JavaScript
- can dockerize things and make them work

That's why I've created one Python container, that includes three main packages/scripts, that help make a website like üî•[underhood.club](https://underhood.club/) with a bit of NLP (NER for finding pages names)
